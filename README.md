# N_QUEENS_PROBLEMS_202401100400154

The N-Queen problem is a classic combinatorial puzzle where N queens must be placed on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. 

Start from the first row and attempt to place a queen in a column where it is safe.

Move to the next row and repeat the process.

If a row has no valid position, backtrack to the previous row and adjust the queen’s placement.

Continue until all N queens are successfully placed or all possible configurations are exhausted.
